  "text": " Good morning. Welcome to Send 7, World News in 7 Minutes. I'm Niall Moore. Today is Friday 3 October 2025. Today we're starting in Europe. In the United Kingdom, two people have died in an attack on a synagogue in the city of Manchester. The attack took place yesterday, which was Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year for Jewish people. The attacker first drove at a crowd of people outside the synagogue before getting out of the car and attacking people with a knife. He was shot dead by armed police officers. Following the attack, the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, made a statement directly to Britain's Jewish population. I promise you that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community. I promise you that over the coming days, you will see the other Britain, the Britain of compassion, of decency, of love. And I promise you that this Britain will come together to wrap our arms around your community. The French Navy has intercepted an oil tanker linked to Russia. The ship is believed to be part of a Russian shadow fleet, boats which are Russian but pretend not to be. French authorities suspect that the oil tanker was used to launch drones which flew over Denmark last week, forcing several airports to close. Two people on the ship were arrested. A spokesperson for the Russian government, Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia had no knowledge of the ship. Africa In Uganda, two Kenyan human rights activists have reportedly been abducted by armed men. The two activists, named Bob and Juggie and Nicholas Oyoh, were in Uganda to attend a political event being held by Bobby Wein, a former pop star who is now running to be president of Uganda, challenging current president Yowari Museveni, who is 80 years old and has been in power since 1986. The two Kenyan activists are currently missing. Ugandan police and army officials say that they do not know where they are. In Morocco, two protesters have been killed by police near the city of Agadir. The protests in Morocco began last Saturday and have spread to many cities in the country. They are another example of the so-called Gen Z protests being led by young people across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Young people in Morocco are angry that their government is spending money on stadiums for the 2030 World Cup rather than building hospitals or improving the economy. In Ethiopia, at least 30 people have died and more than 200 were injured when part of a church collapsed in Amhara in the north of the country. The United States will start giving Ukraine intelligence on targets inside of Russia, according to reports by the Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Satellite images and other data would help Ukraine hit important targets such as oil refineries deep within Russian territory. No further aid to Ukraine has been agreed since Donald Trump became president, but in recent weeks, Trump has made statements suggesting that he is annoyed with President Putin for not making peace. In Colombia, land once owned by the drug lord Pablo Escobar is being given to female victims of armed conflict. The estate, called the Hacienda Napoles, was abandoned in 1933 after Escobar was shot dead by American and Colombian agents. Now, 300 acres are being given to local female farmers who have been forced to leave their homes during many years of armed conflict in Colombia. Philippe Harmon, the director of Colombia's national land agency, called it a quote, historic victory for the women who never stopped fighting. Asia. The Israeli military has stopped a group of boats trying to deliver aid to Gaza. The flotilla of 40 boats was carrying more than 400 foreign activists, including Greta Thunberg, the Swedish activist. Reports say that 39 boats were stopped but one escaped the Israeli military and is still travelling towards Gaza. The Israeli foreign ministry said that the activists would be taken to Israel and then deported to Europe. As the Israeli soldiers were boarding the activists' boats, Greta Thunberg released this message. If you are watching this video, I have been abducted and taken against my will by Israeli forces. Our humanitarian mission was non-violent and abiding by international law. In Afghanistan, internet and communication services have been restored after the Taliban turned them off earlier this week. The Taliban government has not officially said why they cut internet across the country, but it is widely understood that the Taliban see the internet as a way to access immoral media and ideas. And in Nepal. A two-year-old girl has been chosen as the country's new Kumari or living virgin goddess. Kumaris are worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists in Nepal. And a new one is chosen once the previous girl reaches puberty and is considered to have become a mortal. The new Kumari is called Ariatara Shakyah and she is two years and eight months old.

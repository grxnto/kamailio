  "text": " Good morning. This is Send 7 World News in 7 Minutes. I'm Juliet Martin and today is Thursday 2 October 2025. The United States Government has been shut down. This means that government funding has been cut off because the Republican and Democrat parties did not agree on a bill to fund government services. Around 750,000 federal workers have had their jobs suspended and others have been told to work without pay. The Democrat party has refused to support a Republican healthcare bill and called for an extension of healthcare subsidies. This is the 15th time the government has shut down since 1981. The last shutdown in 2018 was the longest lasting 38 days. House Minority Leader Hakeen Jeffries said the Democrats were trying to improve the quality of life of Americans. Donald Trump and Republicans have shut the government down because they don't want to provide healthcare to working class Americans. Federal law prohibits the use of Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance in any way, shape or form to undocumented immigrants. Period. Full stop. That's the law. And Democrats aren't trying to change that. What we are trying to do is negotiate a bipartisan agreement that actually brings the two parties together and funds the government in a way that improves the quality of life of the American people. In Mexico, cases of a flesh-eating parasite increased by 32% in the last month, according to government data. The screw worm outbreak in livestock began in November last year.

The United Nations Security Council has agreed to increase its security mission to address gang violence in Haiti. The security mission began 15 months ago.

UNICEF said that around half of gang members are children. Asia. The Philippines has experienced its deadliest earthquake in more than 10 years on Tuesday night. At least 69 people have been killed and authorities fear the death toll could be higher. At least 186 people have been injured. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9 and destroyed several buildings, including a more than 100-year-old church. In 2013, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake killed 222 people. Indonesia. Indonesia also experienced a magnitude 6.5 earthquake, which made it difficult for rescuers to continue work on a school that collapsed earlier in the week. Three people were injured and dozens of homes were damaged in the earthquake. Six people have been killed in the school collapse. Kyrgyzstan's President Sadov Jayaparov has called for the death penalty to be reinstated for the most serious crimes against children and women. In September, a 17-year-old girl was killed, causing public outrage. Kyrgyzstan was ranked as the most dangerous country for women in Central Asia by the Global Women Peace and Security Index. The proposed law would reinstate the death penalty for rape of children and rape and murder of women. Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary election is planned for 30 November. Africa Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu gave an address for the country's 65th Independence Day yesterday. He said that GDP growth was at its fastest in four years, and inflation was at its lowest in three years.

In Morocco, 263 security forces and 23 civilians have been injured in youth protests, according to authorities. Protests began on Saturday, demanding better education and healthcare. Europe In Germany, three men have been arrested over a suspected plan to target Israeli or Jewish institutions. According to prosecutors, the men are suspected of being Hamas operatives.

Goodall was one of the first female scientists in her field and a pioneer in the study of primate behaviour. She was known for giving chimpanzees names and studying their personalities, relationships and emotions. The Jane Goodall Institute works towards environmental education, health and advocacy. And also, in the United Kingdom, the next Archbishop of Canterbury will be announced on Friday. They will become the 106th Archbishop. The former leader of the Church of England, Justin Welby, resigned last December following a child abuse scandal.

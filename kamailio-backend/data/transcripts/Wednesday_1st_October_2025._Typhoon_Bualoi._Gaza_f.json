  "text": " Good morning, this is Send 7 World News in 7 Minutes. I'm Stephen Devyn Chensy. Today is Wednesday, the 1st of October 2025. Starting in Asia today. In East Asia, the death toll from Typhoon Boaloi has risen to at least 46 with more people missing. Typhoon Boaloi passed through the Philippines over the weekend, Vietnam on Sunday and Monday, and Laos yesterday. Boaloi is now over Myanmar but is much weaker. At the time of recording this podcast, there were also very recent reports of an earthquake in the Philippines. South Korea's intelligence agency has warned about increased risks of cyber attacks at the moment, saying that hackers might take advantage of weaknesses in technology systems after a major fire at a government data center a few days ago. In the Mediterranean Sea, an international collection of boats hoping to reach Gaza with humanitarian aid is only about 400km away, which could take just a few days. The global Sumod flotilla is the biggest attempt of volunteers to reach Gaza by boat, involving about 50 boats. Italian and Spanish Navy ships have accompanied the boats at times after some of them were hit by drones last week. During previous attempts to reach Gaza, Israel has intercepted the boats, detained the people on board, and then deported them. In Indonesia, a school has collapsed, leaving 91 people missing with three confirmed deaths. Parts of the Islamic boarding school were still under construction when the building collapsed and most of the missing are teenage boys. In China, 11 people have been sentenced to death for running cyber crime activities in Myanmar worth over a billion dollars and for killing 14 of the workers who had disobeyed them. All 11 people who have been sentenced to death are members of the same family and another 12 people have received prison time. In Afghanistan, the internet and mobile phone services have been almost completely cut off with the Taliban saying that this is to prevent immorality. America's Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said that the United States is violating international law and that President Donald Trump deserves to be in jail. Last week, after the United Nations General Assembly debate, Gustavo Petro took part in street demonstrations in support of Palestine and in a speech he said that US soldiers should disobey their orders. The United States revoked Petro's visa. In a televised government broadcast yesterday, Petro said that Trump is complicit in the genocide that Israel is committing in Gaza and said that the US is not obeying international law by arresting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is a reference to the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Netanyahu. If Mr Trump keeps being complicit in a genocide as he is today, he deserves nothing but jail and his army should not obey him. The United States in reality does not recognize international law. Any person from any nationality by these courts should be captured by any country, so Netanyahu should be captured in the United States. In the United States, YouTube has agreed to pay President Donald Trump $24.5 million to settle a court case that he brought against them for removing his YouTube channel after the attacks on the US Congress in January 2021. Earlier this year, Metta also settled a similar case with Trump by agreeing to pay him $25 million for shutting down his Facebook account after the January 6th riots. Africa. Madagascar's President Andrii Rajulina has dissolved the government in response to ongoing protests. In a televised broadcast, Rajulina said that his government had not met the needs of the people. The United Nations has said that over 20 people have died in protests over the last four days. These are the biggest protests in Madagascar for decades. Namibia's government has said that fires in the Etosha National Park have been brought under control. The fire has been burning for more than a week, and a third of the park is believed to have been burned. Europe. In Belgium at a joint European Union NATO meeting yesterday, European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU would give Ukraine reparation loans, which would come from frozen Russian assets. NATO head Mark Rutter spoke about the importance of a drone wall to protect Europe from Russian air incursions. The drone wall initiative is timely and necessary, because in the end we cannot spend millions of euros or dollars on missiles to take out the drones, which are only costing a couple of thousand dollars. So we need a drone wall. In Serbia, 11 people have been arrested for hate crimes against Muslims and Jews in France and Germany. France had previously said that they suspected that foreign interference was probably responsible for actions such as placing pigs' heads outside mosques, throwing green paint over a synagogue, and defacing a Holocaust monument. And in Spain, police say that they have arrested three suspected drug traffickers who were pretending to be pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago. In the northwestern region of Galicia, one Colombian man and two Ecuadorians had been watched operating a semi-submersible boat, and when the police detained them, they pretended to be pilgrims. However, the police found them soaking wet, and later found tons of cocaine. A big thank you to Rafao in Poland, Nicola in Italy, and Jaeyoon in Korea for becoming our newest supporters.

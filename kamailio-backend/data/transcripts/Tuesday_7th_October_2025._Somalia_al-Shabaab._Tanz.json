Today is Tuesday, the 7th of October, 2025. Today, we're starting in Africa. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab militants attacked a high-security jail in the capital city Mogadishu. The fighters entered the prison by disguising themselves as soldiers. Al-Shabaab, which is an Islamist group associated with Al-Qaeda, said it had freed, quote, all the Muslim prisoners in the jail. But the Somali government has said that no prisoners escaped during the attack, and that all seven Al-Shabaab militants were killed. In Tanzania, Tundu Lisu, the leader of the main opposition party, has begun his trial for treason. Earlier this year, Tundu Lisu called on his supporters to boycott the upcoming national elections, because he believes the election process benefits the Chamacha Mapundusi Party, which has been in power since 1961. Prosecutors say Lisu was disrupting the upcoming election, and therefore had committed treason. If Lisu is found guilty by the court, he could face the death penalty. America's In the United States, rapper and music producer Sean Coombs, known as Puff Daddy or Diddy, has been sentenced to four years and two months in prison on charges related to prostitution. The Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, or Lula, has asked Donald Trump to drop the 50% tariff on Brazilian goods sold to the US. In a 30-minute phone call, which the Brazilian government called friendly, the two world leaders discussed meeting in person soon and exchanged phone numbers. Lula and Trump met for the first time since this trade war began last week at the UN General Assembly. After that meeting, Trump said that Lula, quote, seemed like a very nice man. Asia, in Tibet. Hundreds of hikers are trapped on Mount Everest after an unexpected snowstorm hit the area over the weekend. The Tibetan side of Mount Everest is a popular destination for more casual hikers and climbers from China. It is less difficult to climb than the side of the mountain in Nepal, where more experienced climbers try to reach the summit. Chinese state media reports that 350 hikers have managed to hike down the mountain and are safe. However, 200 hikers are still trapped on the mountain and one hiker has died. In India, a lawyer has been suspended after he threw his shoe at India's most senior judge, Chief Justice B. R. Gawai. After throwing his shoe, the lawyer Rakesh Kishore reportedly accused Chief Justice Gawai of insulting Hinduism. But it's unclear if or what the Chief Justice said. Mr. Kishore will not face any charges for throwing his shoe. Europe France's Prime Minister, Sebastian Le Corneux, has resigned just 27 days after he was appointed by President Emmanuel Macron. France's parliament, the National Assembly, is very divided. No single party holds a majority, which makes it difficult to pass laws because the Prime Minister needs votes from the far left and the far right. Le Corneux was the fifth Prime Minister in two years and now President Macron, who chooses France's Prime Ministers, is being told by his opponents to either call an election or resign. The World Health Organization, based in Switzerland, has warned about the dangers of smoking e-cigarettes or vaping. A new WHO report estimates that 100 million people worldwide vape, including 15 million children. According to the Director-General of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adonam Guibriessos, tobacco companies are quote aggressively targeting young people with vapes as a way of continuing to make money because fewer and fewer people around the world are smoking cigarettes. And in Sweden, the Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to three scientists, Mary Brunko and Fred Ramsdell from the United States and Shimon Sagaguchi from Japan. They were awarded the prize for their work on quote peripheral immune tolerance. Basically, understanding why our immune systems, which help our bodies fight infections and diseases, don't attack the healthy parts of our bodies. Explaining why he gave them the prize, Professor Thomas Perlman, the Secretary-General of the Nobel Assembly, said, And what these scientists found was an entirely new principle whereby the immune system is kept in check. But there are more than 200 clinical trials ongoing involving this principle. And there's a significant promise and hope that this can be used to treat autoimmune disease, that it can be maybe help to prevent rejections of transplanted organs, and also to treat cancer.

  "text": " Good morning, this is Send 7 World News in 7 Minutes. I'm Stephen Devon-Chenzi. Today is Monday the 6th of October 2025. Starting in Asia today, Israel and Hamas are expected to hold negotiations today in Egypt. This weekend Hamas said that they would agree to parts of a plan by United States President Donald Trump but have not agreed fully to the plan. Trump said on Saturday that Israel should stop its military actions in Gaza and Israel has said that it is now taking only defensive actions. However, Al Jazeera reported yesterday that 19 Palestinians were killed yesterday. President Trump released a statement on Saturday saying that peace was close. Across Europe, hundreds of thousands of people took part in protests against Israel's actions this weekend with the biggest protest in the Netherlands where 250,000 people are believed to have joined a march in Amsterdam. Tomorrow is the second anniversary of the Hamas attacks which started this period of war. On October 7th 2023, Hamas and other Palestinian groups crossed into Israel and killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, including hundreds of young people who were shot dead at a music festival, and hundreds of civilians who were shot dead or burned alive in their homes. Around 250 people were then taken into Gaza as hostages, including women, children and various foreigners, including over 30 farm workers from Thailand. Some of the hostages have been returned in prisoner swaps with Palestinian prisoners, however they are believed to be around 50 hostages remaining, however around half of those are believed to be dead. Since October 7th 2023, 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas. Japan will probably have its first ever female prime minister. Sanae Takayichi was chosen by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as its new leader. To become prime minister, Takayichi must still be confirmed in a vote in parliament next week, however this will probably happen as the LDP has the most seats. Also in Japan, there is a shortage of the beer Asahi after a cyber attack caused problems with shipments of the beer. In Syria, the first parliamentary election, since the fall of the Bashar al-Assad government, took place yesterday. The voting was only done by 6,000 electors, as the transitional government said that it was not possible to conduct a proper election in which everyone can vote. Europe In Czechia, the right-wing populist party, ANO of former Prime Minister Andrei Babis has won the most seats in the parliamentary election. Current Prime Minister Peter Fiala has conceded defeat, saying that his coalition would not be able to form a government. Although ANO has won the most seats, it may still take months to form as it needs 20 more seats to form a majority, and most other parties have said that they wouldn't work with ANO. Russian Missile and Drone Attacks In Ukraine, Russian Missile and Drone Attacks killed at least six civilians yesterday. One of the worst hit areas was the western region of Lviv, which is generally safer than other parts of Ukraine. European Union head of foreign policy, Kaya Kalas, said that Russia was terrorizing civilians to hide its current military failures. In Georgia, there were major protests on Saturday after local elections, which were boycotted by many major parties. There have been ongoing protests over the last year, since parliamentary elections, which opposition parties say were rigged in favour of the ruling Georgian Dream Party. In Germany, a judge has ordered three suspected members of Hamas to be kept in detention until trial. The three men are suspected of having weapons and preparing to attack Jews. Hamas has denied links to the arrested men. Africa Morocco's Prime Minister Aziz Akanous has said that he wants to talk to protesters in order to end demonstrations that have continued for more than a week and resulted in three deaths and hundreds of arrests. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, former President Joseph Kabila has been sentenced to death in absentia. Kabila is accused of supporting the M23 group, which has captured part of eastern DRC and was sentenced to death for war crimes, treason, murder and other crimes. Earlier this year, Kabila visited the city of Goma, which is under M23 control. However, it is not known where Kabila is right now. America's In Brazil, people have been advised to avoid drinking distilled alcohol after cases of methanol poisoning. There has been one confirmed death from methanol poisoning with 11 more confirmed cases and over 100 suspected cases, mostly in Sao Paulo. According to the Associated Press, bars are reporting people drinking beer and wine, but no cocktails, which are normally popular in Brazil. And in the United States, a treasure chest lost for over 300 years has been found. A team of treasure hunting divers in Florida found over a thousand silver and gold coins that are believed to have been created in the Spanish colonies that today make up Mexico, Bolivia and Peru. They are believed to have been lost on the 31st of July 1715, when a hurricane destroyed the ships traveling back to Spain.
